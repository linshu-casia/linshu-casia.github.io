title: "Adaptive Command: Real-Time Policy Adjustment via Language Models in StarCraft II"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/009-DAI2024
excerpt: "We present Adaptive Command, a novel framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with behavior trees for real-time strategic decision-making in StarCraft II. Our system focuses on enhancing human-AI collaboration in complex, dynamic environments through natural language interactions. The framework comprises: (1) an LLM-based strategic advisor, (2) a behavior tree for action execution, and (3) a natural language interface with speech capabilities. User studies demonstrate significant improvements in player decision-making and strategic adaptability, particularly benefiting novice players and those with disabilities. This work contributes to the field of real-time human-AI collaborative decision-making, offering insights applicable beyond RTS games to various complex decision-making scenarios."
