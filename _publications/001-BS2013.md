excerpt: "Thanks to the widespread use of computers, the basic programming ability is becoming an essential skill for almost all the college students. Although many current online judge systems provide stable and efficient services in automated programs testing, it seems that there is limited help to the learners since few study suggestions is given to them. In this case, learners may feel disoriented during their studies. This paper aims to solve this problem by implementing a system based on one existing platform--Bailian, which will evaluate the learner's programming skills by combining three scores from different perspectives separately, and then recommend some suitable tasks to them according to the grades of both learners and problems. The system also includes an automatic problem set generator to generate contests for self-testing. The quality of these contests is guaranteed since the grades as well as the categories of problems are considered during generating. The evaluation of actual effectiveness of the improved system is also provided in this paper. By collecting and analyzing the feedbacks from learners as well as the records of learner's behavior, how much has the system changed in learner's programming learning can be seen clearly."
