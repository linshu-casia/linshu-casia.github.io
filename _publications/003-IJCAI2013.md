excerpt: 'In the Angry Birds game, there are dynamic objects and static objects. Dynamic objects are usually convex polygons, while static objects can be concave. To represent dynamic objects, it is more accurate to use bounding convex polygons (BCPs) than Axis-aligned minimum bounding boxes (AABBs). BCPs can be roughly detected from AABBs, and some of them can be fitted into rectangles. We take another approach to detect concave objects, such as mountains. We apply edge detection and Hough Transform to build polygons to represent mountains. In this paper, we mainly introduce our work on detecting BCPs and representing concave objects.'
