permalink: /publication/010-DAI2025
excerpt: "Railway transportation systems worldwide face increasing pressure to maximize capacity while maintaining safety and operational efficiency. Complex scheduling conflicts frequently arise due to the inherent strict constraints in railway networks, including track sharing, station capacity limitations, and various train operational requirements. Effective conflict resolution methods are crucial for maintaining reliable railway services and optimizing infrastructure utilization. To address these challenges, we propose the RailSched, a novel intelligent decision framework for railway scheduling optimization. Our research by providing an intelligent and multi-strategy approach that reduces dispatcher workload, minimizes conflicts, and improves overall system reliability. The key contributions of this paper are fourfold: 1) we propose a railway schedule environment model for simulation; 2) develop a diverse strategy library targeting conflicts; 3) present an intelligent algorithmic framework for policy decision making and 4) explore the integration of large language models(LLMs) for railway schedule, an optional AI-enhanced decision module. Our evaluation using real railway data validates RailSched’s effectiveness, achieving a 85.05% improvement over expert-designed solutions in the most complex scenario, highlighting its practical value for modern railway dispatching."
